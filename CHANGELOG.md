# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2022-01-23

- Forked https://github.com/bodil/typed-html to https://github.com/dgellow/typed-html.
- Fixes master branch build errors.
- Removed use of [proc_macro_hack](https://crates.io/crates/proc-macro-hack) crate. (#https://github.com/dgellow/typed-html/pull/1)

## [0.2.2] - 2020-02-07

## Fixed

-   Changed some internal uses of `into_iter()` to `iter()` for future proofing. (#78)

## [0.2.1] - 2019-06-28

### Added

-   Most types now implement `Send`. (#53)
-   All tags now support the ARIA `role` attribute. (#47)
-   The `text!()` macro now accepts expressions as value arguments. (#48)
-   You can now create "unsafe" text nodes with the `unsafe_text!()` macro, which won't be quoted at
    all when stringifying, even if they contain HTML tags. This is a meaningless distinction when
    creating DOM nodes, however, and unsafe text nodes will behave like normal text nodes in this
    case. (#39)

### Changed

-   Text in attributes are quoted less aggressively when stringified. (#26, #49)
-   Attribute type conversion is now using the recently stabilised `TryFrom` instead of `From`, to
    avoid relying on panicking `From` implementations to detect conversion errors, though the
    conversions inside the macro will still panic if they fail. The appropriate `TryFrom`
    implementations have been added to `Class`, `Id`, `SpacedList` and `SpacedSet`, and the
    corresponding `From` implementations have been removed.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-03-16

### Added

-   Support for the [Dodrio](https://github.com/fitzgen/dodrio) virtual DOM renderer: the
    `dodrio_macro` feature flag enables the `typed_html::dodrio` macro, which generates code to
    build a `dodrio::Node` directly, without going via `VNode`s. (#38)

### Fixed

-   Added the missing attributes to the `<video>` tag, which was previously listed as having none.
    (#32)

## [0.1.1] - 2018-11-29

### Added

-   `typed-html` now works on stable rustc. (#1)
-   All elements and HTML marker traits now implement `IntoIterator`, so you can return them
    directly from a group. (#12)

### Fixed

-   Boolean flags are now correctly rendered as empty when stringifying. (#13, #14)
-   Non-self-closing tags are now correctly rendered with a closing tag in the HTML style, rather
    than in the XML style. (#15, #16)

## [0.1.0] - 2018-11-17

This is the initial release.
